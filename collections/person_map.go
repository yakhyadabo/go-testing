package collections
// Maps in Go are unordered collections of key-value pairs, similar to Javaâ€™s HashMap.


//Maps are created using the make function:
// myMap := make(map[string]int) // creates a map with string keys and integer values


// You can add or update elements in a map using the following syntax:
//myMap["one"] = 1
//myMap["two"] = 2


// Retrieving an element from a map is done by specifying its key:
// value := myMap["one"] // value is 1


// You can also delete elements from a map using the delete function:
// delete(myMap, "one") // removes the key "one" and its associated value from the map
